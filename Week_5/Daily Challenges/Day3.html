<!-- The onkeypress attribute is a JavaScript event attribute that executes the following peice of code whenever a user press
key from his keyboard. Inside this function, we check if the character code of the input character lies between the
standard ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character codes for alphabets. 
The capital A-Z start from 65 and ends at 90 and small a-z starts from 97 and ends at 122. Here is the code for allowing only alphabets on key press.-->
